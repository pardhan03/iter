# Iter - A Rust Project for Understanding Iterators

This project, **Iter**, is designed to explore and practice the usage of **iterators** in Rust. The goal of this application is to deepen the understanding of Rust’s ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and the Option enum while focusing on iterators and their role in iterating over data structures such as vectors.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Iterators** in Rust
- **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes**
- **Option Enum**
- Working with **Vectors** and **For Loops**

## Project Breakdown:
In this project, we will:
- Create a vector of strings.
- Implement simple functions to manipulate the vector using iterators.
- Learn how iterators interact with Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the mechanics of iterators in Rust.
- Learn how to handle ownership and lifetimes within the context of iteration.
- Get comfortable with the `Option` enum when working with iterators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Rust (Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started))
